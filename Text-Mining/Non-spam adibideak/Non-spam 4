Hi there,
 
We have two new ways for you to have fun creating with Unity, check them out:
 
Introducing Micro-Games & Mods
Unity has a fun, new self-guided learning path to help you dive into the editor 
and create a playable game in as little as 30 minutes. Just open the Unity Hub 
(be sure to update it if prompted), go to the Learn tab, and pick the Karting or 
2D Platformer Micro-Game. If you don't have the Unity Hub, download it from the “New Users” path. 

See you there!
Sam “Sykoo”, Unity
