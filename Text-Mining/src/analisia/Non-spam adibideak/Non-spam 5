Recent scientific brain research has shown that learning a new skill actually changes your brain (in a good way)! 
Or put another way, the more you practice, the easier the new skill actually gets.

With that in mind, we wanted to check in and see how you’re progressing with Unity. If you started the 2D Game Kit 
Lesson 1 and got stuck, don’t give up. It’s probably just some minor detail that’s holding you back. Remember you 
can check the supporting videos and the 2D Game Kit forum.

If you just haven’t had time to complete the lesson, well that’s understandable. But we hope you’ll get back to it 
because it’s one more step toward creating your own game in Unity.
