Please note that starting from October 30, 2015 we will be introducing new online banking authentication
procedures in order to protect the information of our online banking users.

You are required to confirm your personal details with us as you will not be able access our online service until this
has been done. As you're already registered for online banking all you need to do is to confirm your online banking 
details.

Get Started 

Once you've completed this process you'll be able to have full access to our online banking service.

Best regards,
Natwest Online Banking Team
